## Sequence of tenses

**Rule I.** The tenses in Latin are divided into two groups:

| Group | Indicative | Subjunctive |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| A. Primary tenses | Present. <br>Future. <br>Perfect with “have.” | Present. <br>Perfect. |
| B. Historic tenses | Imperfect. <br>Perfect without “have.” (Aorist.)  <br>Pluperfect. | Imperfect. <br>Pluperfect. |

Where we have a dependent sentence with its verb in the Subjunctive, the tense of the Subjunctive is determined by the tense of the principal verb. Primary tenses follow Primary, Historic tenses follow Historic.[^1]

The English will generally make it quite clear which of the two Primary tenses, or which of the two Historic tenses, is required in each case.

## Final Sentences

**Rule 2.** Final Sentences (i.e. sentences expressing a *purpose*) have their verbs in the Subjunctive, introduced by *ut* when positive, by *ne* when negative.

### Examples

- Laborant pauperes **ut** divites **fiant**.

  *Poor men work to become rich.*

- Se receperunt **ne** consilia ab hostibus **cognoscerentur**.

  *They retreated in order that their plans might not be discovered by the enemy.*
