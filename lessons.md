## Sequence of tenses

**Rule I.** The tenses in Latin are divided into two groups:

| Group | Indicative | Subjunctive |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| A. Primary tenses | Present. <br>Future. <br>Perfect with “have.” | Present. <br>Perfect. |
| B. Historic tenses | Imperfect. <br>Perfect without “have.” (Aorist.)  <br>Pluperfect. | Imperfect. <br>Pluperfect. |

Where we have a dependent sentence with its verb in the Subjunctive, the tense of the Subjunctive is determined by the tense of the principal verb. Primary tenses follow Primary, Historic tenses follow Historic.¹

The English will generally make it quite clear which of the two Primary tenses, or which of the two Historic tenses, is required in each case.

¹ The Historic Present may be regarded either as a Primary or as a Historic tense. The Imperative is always followed by a Primary tense.

## Final Sentences

**Rule 2.** Final Sentences (i.e. sentences expressing a *purpose*) have their verbs in the Subjunctive, introduced by *ut* when positive, by *ne* when negative.

### Examples

- Laborant pauperes **ut** divites **fiant**.

  *Poor men work to become rich.*

- Se receperunt **ne** consilia ab hostibus **cognoscerentur**.

  *They retreated in order that their plans might not be discovered by the enemy.*

## Consecutive Sentences

**Rule 3.** Consecutive Sentences (i.e. sentences expressing a consequence) have their verbs in the Subjunctive introduced by ut. When the consequence is negative we have ut non, ut nemo, ut nullus, ut nunquam, etc., according to the sense.¹

### Examples

- Tantum est periculum ut omnes terreantur.
  
  _So great is the danger that all are frightened._

- Tam celeriter se receperunt ut hostes eos capere non possent.
  
  _They retreated so speedily that the enemy could not catch them._

¹ The sequence of tenses is the same as for Final clauses, with one exception; viz. the Perfect Subj. is often used after a historic tense. But only use it thus when (a) the result is "momentary," not continuous, and (b) the result actually did follow. e.g. Tantus erat ardor militum ut nemo motum terrae senserit. _The soldiers were so engrossed that no one fell the earthquake._

In the following exercises (10-19) Final and Consecutive sentences are mixed. When the sentence is negative remember that a negative final sentence always begins with ne, a consccutive sentence never does. Therefore for "that no one" use ne quis in a final, ut nemo in a consecutive sentence; "that no ... " use ne ullus or ut nulius; "that never " use ne unquam or ut nunquam.

## Infinitives

**Rule 4.** The simple use of the Infinitive is as the subject or complement of a finite verb. It thus corresponds to the English verbal noun in -ing.

e.g. laborare est orare = _working is praying._

Here 'laborare' is the subject of 'est,' and 'orare' is the complement, just as, in the sentence 'laborare est difficile,' 'difficile' is the complement. This last sentence we usually translate "It is difficult to work," but the Latin is "To work is difficult," and 'laborare' is a true subject.

All verbs whose meaning is incomplete in itself require a complement, and this is usually in the Infinitive. We call
it the Prolate Infinitive.

e.g. 

- volo abire = _I wish to go away._
- conor laborare = _I try to work._
- possum vincere = _I can conquer._
- te sino proficisci = _I permit you to depart._

## Participles

Rule 5. English sentences which require to be translated by participles in Latin are not usually in the Latin form at first. The English has to be turned; e.g. "The Greeks, having captured Troy, burnt it," cannot go straight into Latin, because Latin has no Perfect Participle Active.

(a) Wherever possible, make the participle agree with the subject or object.

e.g.

- _The Greeks having captured Troy, burnt it._ = Trojam captam Graeci incenderunt.¹
- _The chiefs were taken and massacred._ = Capti duces trucidantur.

(7) Wherever this is not possible, use the construction called Ablative Absolute; i.e. a Participle agreeing with a Noun in the Ablative, the whole phrase being an Abl. of Manner or "Attendant Circumstances"; e.g. in the sentence "_Having taken the city, he marched on,_" the participle cannot agree with the subject because there is no Perfect Participle Active in Latin, nor can 'the city' be made the object of the verb. We therefore turn it: "_The city having been captured, he marched on_" = Capta urbe progressus est.

¹ Never write such a sentence as "Capta urbe, Graeci eam incenderunt." The Abl. Abs. is only to be used where the participle _cannot_ agree with subject or object.

[page 26]

1. Do not invent a Passive Participle of Intransitive Verbs. Saying "Caesare pervento" is absurd as saying "perventus est" for _he arrived_. Latin having no Perfect Part. Active, the only way to rener "Caesar having arrived" is "Caesar quum pervenisset."¹

2. On the other hand remember that Deponents have Perfect Participles with an Active sense, though their form is Passive; e.g. locutus = having said, aggressus = having attacked, ratus = thinking, etc.

¹ See the first part of Rule 26, p. 144.

[page 27]

1. "_Saying this, he fled_" is a loose way of expressing "_Having said this he fled_"; and in Latin must be "Haec looutus fugit." The Present Participle always denotes an action going on at the same time as the action of the principle verb, whatever the tense of that verb may be; e.g. Hoc jam moriens dixit=he said this while dying.

2. We must often use participles in Latin where they are not used in English.
 1. Where English uses two simple verbs joined by "and" or "but"; e.g. _Numa died and Tullus became king_=Mortuo Numa Tullus rex factus est; _He took him and slew him_-Captum eum interfecit.
 2. Where English uses phrases with prepositions or conjunctions; e.g. _He was killed while hunting_=interfectus est venans; _on the death of Numa_=mortuo Numa; _after advancing a mile_=mille passus progressus.
 3. Where English uses clauses denoting time, cause, etc.; e.g _When Tullus was king_=regnante Tullo; _As the soldiers would not follow, he remained_ = nolentibus sequi militibus, mansit.

## Time, Place, Space

**Rule 6.**

### Time.

To be expressed without a preposition.

| Sense | Case | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| Time during which | Accusative. | e.g. Triginta annos vivit. _He lived 30 years._ |
| Time when. | Ablative. | e.g. Tricesimo anno mortuus est. _He died in the 30th year._ |
| Time within which | Ablative. | e.g. Multis annis Romam non venit. _For many years he did not go to Rome._ |

N.B.

- Undeviginti annos natus. _Nineteen years old._
- Tribus ante (post) diebus. _Three days before (after)._  
- Abhinc tres dies. _Three days ago._

### Place

To be expressed with a preposition, except in the case of towns, small islands, domus, rus.

| Sense | Case | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| Place whither. | Accusative. | e.g. In urbem. _into the city._ Athenas, _to Athens._ |
| Place whence. | Ablative. | e.g. Ex Italia, _out of Italy._ Romā, _from Rome._ Domo, _from home._|
| Place where. | Ablative. | e.g. In urbe. _in the city._|

But to express place where use the Locative of towns, small islands, domus, rus, humus; e.g. Romae, Athenis, Corinthi, Rhodi, ruri, humi.

### Extent of Space

To be expressed by the Accusative without a preposition.

e.g. 
- Tria millia passuum progressus. _Having advanced three miles._
- Tredecim pedes altus (latus, longus). _Thirteen feet high (broad, long)._
- Castra ab urbe aberant millia passuum ducenta. _The camp was distant from the city 200 miles._

## Ablatives of Comparison, Quality, Measure of Difference; Words Governing the Ablative

1. Quid mollius undā?¹ _What is softer than water?_
2. Stătūrā fuit humili. _He was of low stature._
3. Multis partibus/multo major est. _It is much greater._

¹ The Abl. of Comparison is only to be used where two things are directly compared with one another by means of a Comparative Adjective. Otherwise use quam. The case of the noun following quam will be the same as that of the noun corresponding to it in the first part of the sentence.

e.g.

- Facilius est mihi quam tibi. _It is easier for me than for you._
- Balbi domus quam Caii altior est. _Balbus' house is higher than Caius'_

Compare with these-

- Facilior est somnus labore. _Sleep is easier than toil._
- Domus muro altior est. _The house is higher than the wall._

In these sentences we have direct comparison between the two things denoted by the nouns, and can therefore use the Ablative of Comparison.

## Indirect Statement

In the sentence "He said many things" the verb governs a noun as direct object. In the sentence "He said that I was unwise" a clause has taken, the place of a direct object. When in this way a sentence becomes the object of a verb of "saying" or "thinking" we call it an "indirect statement."

When the verb of 'saying' or 'thinking' is in the Passive the 'indirect statement' becomes the subject, e.g. nuntiatur hostem adesse="_that the enemy are near_" is announced. So with 'impersonals' like constat (_it is agreed_).

**Rule 6.** When a statement is made dependent on a verb of "saying" or "thinking" the subject of the dependent clause is put in the Accusative, and the verb in the Infinitive.

Verbs of "saying" and "thinking" include all such verbs as learn, perceive, kenow. .hear, pretend, inform, hope, promise, threaten-of which hope, promise, threaten are always followed by the Future Infinitive. The subject of the
Infinitive must always be expressed.

"I deny " and "I say that. . not" are both translated in Latin by nego. Never use dico ... non.

### Examples

| Direct Statement | Indirect Statement. |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Ille vir bonus est. _He is a good man._ | Putamus illum virum esse bonum. _We think he is a good man._ |
| Legiones sequentur. _The legions will follow._ | Dixerunt legiones secturas esse. _They said the legions will follow._ |
| Copiae advenerunt. _Forces have arrived._ | Senserunt copiae advenisse. _They perceived that forces had arrived._ |
| Urbs non capietur. _The city will not be taken._ | Negant urbem captum iri.¹ _They say that the city will not be taken. |
| Regrediar. _I shall return._ | Spero me regressurum esse. _I hope to return._ |

¹ For the explanation of this construction see p. 82, note 1.

## Se, Ipse

Latin has no Reflexive Pronoun of the 1st and 2nd Persons, but ipse may be used as an adj, in agrcement with the Pronoun (expressed or understood from the verb); e.g. tu ipse=you yourself, mihi ipsi=to me myself, vos ipsos=you yourselves.

In the 3rd Person se is the Reflexive Pronoun, both Masc, and Fem., Sing. and Plu. It has no Nom., and for 'he himself,' 'they themselves' we must use ipse, ipsi in agreement with the subject.

**Rule 7.** In simple sentences "se" refers to the subject of its own clause. In Indirect Statement (Acc. with Inf.) use
se with reference to the subject of the principal verb; i.e. the verb of 'saying.' 'Eum,' 'eos' must not be used for the speaker.

The adj. suus follows the same rule, and ejus must not be used for it.

### Examples

- Ad eum discedite (vos) ipsi. _Go to him yourselves._
- Se sua pecunia liberavit. _He freed himself with his own money._
- Ariovistus respondet non sese iis sed eos sibi bellum intulisse. _Ariovistus replied that he had not waged war on them (the Gauls), but they on him._

## Tenses of the Infinitive in Indirect Statement

**Rule 8.** If the time referred to by the Infinitive is the same as the time of the verb of saying or thinking, the Present must be used. Otherwise use the Perfect or Future according to the tense of English.

The tense of the Infinitive is always the tense that was used by the speaker in Direct Statement; e.g. "He said he was ill." The actual words were, "I am ill." Therefore use the Present Infinitive.

### Examples

(a) Caesar per exploratores cognovit et montem a suis teneri et Helvetios castra movisse.

_Caesar ascertained through scouts that the mountain was being held by his own men, and that the Helvetii had moved their camp._

## Price and Value.

The 'Genitive of Value' (tanti, quanti, minoris, minimi, magni, pluris, flocci, etc .- which are properly Locatives) is only to be used of indefinite value with verbs of estimating or valuing.

If the price is exactly stated the Ablative of Price (which is really an Abl. of Instrument) must be used.

e.g. Multis talentis emptam domum nihili aestimat. _A house bought for many talents he values at nothing._

## Partitive Genitive

Britannorum fortissimi = _Bravest of/among the Britons._

nimis, parum, satis, aliquid virtutis = _too much, too little, enough, some courage_

## Passive of Intransitive Verbs

**Rule 9.** Intransitive Verbs cannot be used personally in the Passive, but they can be used impersonally:

e.g. Pugnatum est diu = _the battle lasted long._ Concurritur undique = _men run together from all sides._

We can often express the same English by an intrans. or by a trans. verb:

e.g.
- _The Romans are helped_ = succurritur Romanis, or juvantur Romani.
- _I was commanded_ = imperatum est mihi, or jussus sum.
- _I was advised_ = suasum est mihi, or monitus sum.

N.B .- Remember that all "Dative Verbs" (i.e. all verbs that govern the Dative only) are Intransitive.

## Direct Command or Petition¹

**Rule 10.** 
- Second Person.
  - If positive = Imperative.
  - If negative =
    - (a) Ne with Perfect Subj.
    - (b) Imperat. of nolo with Inf.
- First and Third Persons. Present Subj., with ne if negative.

### Examples.

- _Do not buy this horse_ = Hunc equum ne emeris. Hunc equum noli emere.
- _Let us (not) buy this horse_ = Hunc equum (ne) emamus.

When a command is double, and the second part negative, use neu or neve instead of neque, before the second part.

e.g.

- Maneamus in urbe neve discedamus. _Let us remain in the city and not depart._
- Ne iratus sis neve me reliqueris. _Do not be angry or leave me._

¹ This is inserted here for convenience of revision before doing Indirect Command.

## Indirect Command and Petition

In the sentences "He commands the building of a bridge," "He demands the payment of the money," the verbs 'commands' and 'demands' govern direct objects. But usually the place of this direct object is taken by a clause ; e.g. "He commands that the bridge be built," "He demands that the moncy be paid." these clauses are "noun sentences," and are as truly the objects of the principal verbs as the nouns 'building' and 'payment' in the first sentences. These object-sentences after verbs of asking and commanding are what we mean by "Indirect Commands."

**Rule 11.** Indirect Commands are expressed in Latin by ut (when positive) ne (when negative) with the Subjunctive.

The construction is exactly the same as that of Final Sentences.

Exceptions.- Jubeo, veto, take Present Infinitive. Avoid jubeo . . non, for which impero ne or veto must be used.

Neu (neve) is used for neque in Indirect as in DirectCommands and Final Sentences.

### Examples.

- (a) Persuadet Rauracis ut una cum Helvetiis proficiscantur. _He persuades the Rauraci to set out with the Helvetii._
- (b) Pontem, qui erat ad Genavam, jubet rescindi. _He orders the bridge at Geneva to be broken dou._
- (c) Se gladio transfixit ne fame periret neve ab hostibus caperetur. _He fell on his sword that he might not die of hunger or be taken by the enemy._

## Words That May Introduce Statements and Commands

**Rule 12. The verbs moneo, persuadeo, suadeo, may introduce either an Indirect statement or an Indirect command.** In the former case, of course, they take Acc. with Inf. E.g. in the sentence "I will persuade him that this journey is dangerous," the word "persuade" introduces a statement; but in "I will persuade him to abandon this journey" it introduces a command.

### Example

Civitati persuasit ut de finibus suis exirent: perfacile esse totius Galliae imperio potiri. _He persuaded the State to migrate from their territories (Ind. command) ; saying that it was easy to become supreme in Gaul (Ind. statement)._

There is a similar ambiguity in the use of the English "tell," which may introduce either statement or command; e.g. "I told him the journey was dangerous," and "I told him to abandon the journey."

## Dative of Purpose, or Predicative Dative

- Exitio est avidum mare nautis. _The greedy sea is a destruction to sailors._
- Hosti ludibrio esse. _To be a laughing-stock to the enemy._
- Auxilio Caesari mittitur. _He is sent to the help of Caesar._

These Datives are never qualified by an epithet, except the simplest of quantity; e.g. magno dedecori esse = _to be a great disgrace_. They are almost always accompanied by a Dativus Commodi, as nautis, hosti, Cacsari in the above examples.

## Ablatives of Origin, Separation, Association.¹

1. Jove natus = Son of Jupiter.
2. Libera nos metu = Free us from fear.
3. Divitiis abundat = He has plenty of money.

¹ Earlier exercises on the Ablative are given on pages 36, 37.

## Ablatives of Respect and Manner.

1. Numero superiores = _Greater in number._
2. Summa diligentia naves armare = _To fit ships with great care._

The Ablative of Manner must have an epithet, except in a few words: e.g. jure (_rightly_), injuria (_wrongly_), fraude (_treacheronsly_), silentio (_in silence_), etc. If there is no epithet use cum: e.g. cum diligentia naves armare.

## Gerunds and Gerundives.

Distinguish the Gerund and Gerundive.

1. The Gerund is a Verbal Noun of the Active Voice, corresponding to the English verbal nouns in -ing; not to be confused with the Present Participle in -ing which is really an Adjective.
2. The Gerundive is a Verbal Adjective of the Passive Voice.

**Rule 13.** A. The oblique cases of the Gerund are used simply as the cases of a Noun. But the Accusative can only be used governed by a Preposition.

e.g.

- Acc. natus ad regendum = _born to rule._
- Gen. cupidus discendi = _desirous of learning._
- Dat. studuit discendo = _he was devoted to learning._
- Abl. (in) discendo sapientior fio = _by learning I become wiser._

When the Gerund is in the Genitive case or the Ablative without a Preposition it may take a direct object.¹

e.g. 
- Gen. pacem petendi causa = _for the sake of seeking peace._
- Abl. scribendo fabulas = _in writing stories._

B. But when the Verbal Noun governs a direct object² instead of the Gerund we generally use the Gerundive. This attracts the object into its own case, but agrees with the object in number and gender. This construction is known as "Gerundive Attraction."

e.g.
- Acc. ad pacem petendam = in order to ask for peace.
- Gen. pacis petendae causa = for the sake of asking for peace.
- Dat. legibus mutandis studuit = he was eager for changing the laws.
- Abl. in scribendis fabulis = in writing stories.

¹ Use the Gerund especially where by using the Gerundive we should get two genitives ending in -orum or -arum together.

² The Gerundive being Passive, none but transitive verbs (governing a direct object in the Acc.) can have a Gerundive. But utendus, potiundus, fruendus, can be used from utor, potior, fruor.

## Supines.

Besides the Gerund there is another Verbal Noun in Latin called the Supine. It only has two cases-an Acc. in -um, and an Abl. in -u.

**Rule 14.** The Supine in -um can only be used to express purpose after Verbs of motion. It may govern an object.¹

The Supine in -u can only be used after Adjectives,² and corresponds to an Infinitive following an Adjective in English, e.g. "a question hard to answer."

### Examples

- Abii dormitum = I went away to sleep.
- Venerunt pacem petitum = They came to ask for peace.
- Mirabile dictu = wonderful to relate.

¹ The Future Infinitive Passive is made np of the Supine with iri, so that in the sentence 'Dixerunt nos interfectum iri,' interfectum really governs nos, being a supine of purpose after iri.
² Also certain indeclinable nouns used as adjectives, e.g. fas (right), nefas (wrong).

## Direct Questions¹

**Rule 15.** Direct Questions may be asked without any special Interrogative word, but they are frequently introduced
- (a) by Interrogative Pronouns or Adverbs, such as quis, who? quando,² when? ubi, where?
- (b) by Interrogative Particles. These Particles are in Single Questions -ne (enclitic), nonne (expecting answer "yes"), num (expecting answer "no"); in Double Questions utrum ... an, -ne ... an, utrum . .. annon.

### Examples

- (a) Caesarne ad castra advenit? _Has Caesar reached the camp?_
- (b) Nonne Caesar ad castra advenit? _Has not Caesar reached the camp? Surely Caesar has reached the camp?_
- (c) Num Caesar ad castra advenit? _Caesar has not reached the camp, has he?_³
- (d) Utrum Caesar (or Caesarne) ad castra advenit annon? _Has Caesar reached the camp or not?_

[N.B .- Do not append the -ne to an unemphatic word.]

¹ This rule is inserted here for convenience of revision before doing Indirect Questions.

² When in questions is never quum but quando. Notice also that where is often used in English for whither, and in this sense must be translated by quo.

³ Notice the form of the English. "Has he?" "is he?" "isn't he?"' etc., is only our way of showing what answer we expect, and is fully represented in Latin by the nonne or num at the beginning of the sentence.

## Indirect Questions

In the sentence "He asked what I was doing" the clause 'what I was doing' is really the object of the verb 'asked.' In the sentence "What he is doing is uncertain" the clause 'what he is doing' is really the subject of 'is.'

When a direct question becomes thus the subject or object of a verb we call it an Indirect Question.

**Rule 16.** A clause expressing an Indirect Question in Latin always has its verb in the Subjunctive.

The principal verb may be any such word as ask, know, doubt, consider, tell, etc.

In the above examples it will be noticed that we supply a Future Subjunctive by what is called the periphrastic conjugation, i.e., the Fut. Participle with sim in Primary, essem in Historic sequence.

### Primary Tenses

| Main clause | Question word | Subordinate clause|
|---------------------|------|-------------------|
| Rogat¹ <br> _He asks_ | quid <br> _what_ | agam. <br> _I am doing._ |
| Rogabit <br> _He will ask_ | quid <br> _what_ | acturus sim. <br> _I am going to do._ |
| Rogavit <br> _He has asked_ | quid <br> _what_ | egerim.² <br> _I did._ |

### Historic Tenses

| Main clause | Question word | Subordinate clause|
|---------------------|------|-------------------|
| Rogabat <br> _He was asking_ | quid <br> _what_ | agerem. <br> _I was doing._ |
| Rogavit <br> _He asked_ | quid <br> _what_ | acturus essem. <br> _I was going to do._ |
| Rogaverat <br> _He had asked_ | quid <br> _what_ | egissem. <br> _I had done._ |

e.g.

- Nescio quando venturi sint. _I do not know when they will come._
- Nesciebam quando venturi essent. _I did not know when they would come._

The interrogative particles are the same as in direct questions (whether single or double). But in indirect questions num does not necessarily expect the answer 'no,' and necne must be used for annon. "If" meaning "whether" introducing a question must never be translated si, but in single questions by num, in double questions by utrum/-ne... an. "When" in questions is quando, never quum.

¹ The imperative is a Primary tense:

| Main clause | Question word | Subordinate clause|
|---------------------|------|-------------------|
| Roga <br> _Ask_ | quid <br> _what_ | agat. <br> _he is doing._ |
| " | " | acturus sit. <br> _he is going to do._ |
| " | " | egerit. <br> _he did._ |

² The PErfect represents a completed action. Therefore use the Perf. Subj. when the governing verb is primary and the dependent verb relates to an action completed in past time, e.g. Nescio quodmodo mortuus sit = _I do not know how he died._

## Subordinate Clauses in Indirect Statement, etc.

**Rule 17.** All clauses which are subordinate to an indirect statement or command or question have their verbs in the subjunctive.

### Example

Ariovistus respondet se non in eas partes Galliae venire audere quas Caesar possideret.

_Ariovistus replied that he did not dare to come into those parts of Gaul which Caesar held._

## Impersonal Verbs

1. In using oportet there is the same difficulty as in using debeo. In English we say, "_I ought to have come,_" expressing the Perfect tense in the Infinitive. In Latin the tense must be expressed in the modal
verb, not in the following Infinitive; e.g. Debui venire or oportuit me venire. There is the same difference in the use of possum ; e.g. Potui hoc facere = _I might have done this_.

2. Remember that se refers to the subject of the sentence. An impersonal verb has no subject, and therefore cannot be followed directly by se; e.g. _He was ashamed_ = eum puduit. If, however, the impersonal is used in an indireet statement se must be used for the third person, because it refers to the subject of the verb of saying; e.g. Dixit se pudere = _He said he was ashamed_. See Rule 7, p. 40.

## Genitive Case.¹

¹ An earlier exercise on the Genitive will be found on page 50.

## Relative with the Subjunctive

**Rule 18.** A relative with the subjunctive may express many adverbial meanings, especially a Purpose or a Consequence.

This is the regular way of expressing a Purpose-

1. When the subject of the subordinate sentence is the same as the subject or object of the Principal Verb.
2. When the subordinate clause contains a comparative, in which case quo (the abl. of the relative) is
regularly used for ut.¹

A Consequence is most often expressed in this way with the phrases is qui, dignus qui, and sunt qui.

### Examples

#### Final.

- Duas legiones reliquit quae auxilio duci possent. _He left two legions to be brought up as reinforcements._
- Nervii murum aedificaverunt quo facilius equitatum impedirent. _The Nervii built a wall the more easily to hinder the cavalry._

#### Consecutive

- Non is sum qui mortis periculo terrear. _I am not the man to be frightened by the fear of death._
- Dignus erat qui rex fieret. _He deserved to be made king._
- Sunt qui non habeant. _There are some who have not (or some men have not)._

¹ We thus have four ways of expressing purpose in Latin, viz. as in the following sentences:
1. Legatos miserunt ut pacem peterent (Rule 2).
2. Legatos miserunt qui pacem peterent.
3. Legatos miserunt ad pacem petendam. Legatos miserunt pacis petendae causa (Rule 13).
4. Legatos miserunt pacem petitum (Rule 14).

Occasionally also purpose is expressed by the Future participle; e.g. Legatos miserunt pacem petituros.

## Gerund and Gerundive Expressing Obligation

(Translation of "ought," "must.")

**Rule 19.** The Nominative of both Gerundive and Gerund is used to express obligation. The Gerundive is used with Transitive Verbs, the Gerund with Intransitive Verbs.

e.g. 
- Gerundive-leges mutandae sunt = _the laws must be changed._
- Gerund-succurrendum est amicis = _we must help our friends._

When these statements become indirect the Acc. is used in the same sense of obligation.

e.g.
- Gerundive-dixit leges mutandas esse.
- Gerund-dixit succurrendum esse amicis.

**Rule 20.** In this construction the person on whom the obligation lies is expressed by the Dative. This is often called Dative of the Agent. But for the sake of clearness, where there is another Dative, the Agent is expressed by ab with the Abl.

e.g. 
- Leges nobis mutandae sunt = _we must change the laws._
- Legibus a nobis parendum est = _we must obey the laws._

N.B.

1. The English words "ought," "must," etc., are often to be translated into Latin by this construction. Remember that the Gerundive is a Passive Adjective, and before translating we must turn the English in thought into a Passive form.

e.g _We must change the laws_ = _The laws are to-be-changed by us_ = Leges nobis mutandae sunt.

2. Observe also that the Gerundive can be used with any tense of sum according to the sense, and the English translations will be very various, because our words "must" and "ought " have only one tense.

e.g. 
- Leges nobis mutandae erunt = _We shall have to change the laws._ (_literally, the laws will be to-be-changed by us._)
- Leges nobis mutandae erant = _We ought to have changed the laws._

The Gerund in like manner can be used with any tense.

e.g. Legibus a nobis parendum fuit = _We had to obey the laws._

## Verbs of Fearing

**Rule 21.** Verbs of Fearing have three constructions-
- (a) Prolate Infinitive.
- (b) ne with Subjunctive.
- (c) ne non with Subjunctive.

### Examples.

- (a) Timeo redire. _I am afraid to return._
- (b) Timeo ne redeat. _I am afraid that he will¹ return (of his returning)._
- (c) Timebam ne non rediret.² _I was afraid he would not return._
  - Timeo ne non redierit. _I am afraid he has not returned._
  - Timebam ne non rediisset. _I was afrard he had not returned._

N.B. (b) and (c) are Final Sentences, Latin preferring to express the object or desire of the person fearing, while Eng. gives the exact opposite; viz., the thing you wish to avoid. Of course (a) is only possible when the subject of the two verbs is the same.

¹ In clauses after verbs of fearing there is no need to express the English Future (as in Indirect questions) by the Periphrastic Conjugation (Rule 16). The Present (in Primary sequence) and Imperfect (in Historic sequence) are used for it without causing any ambiguity.

² Ut may sometimes take the place of ne non (especially after vereor).

## Causal Clauses

A Causal Clause is one whicl gives a reason for the state ment of the principal cause.

**Rule 22.** Causal Clauses have their verb
- (a) in the Indicative when the actual cause of a fact is given,
- (b) in the Subjunctive when only a suggested reason is given.

But quum (since) always takes Subj.

N.B. Of course the Indicative of a Causal clause becomes Subjunctive if it forms part of an Indirect Statement. See Rule 17.

### Examples.

- (a) Tacent quia periculum metuunt. _They are silent because they fear danger._
- (b) Socrates accusatus est quod juventutem corrumperet. _Socrates was accused on the ground that he corrupted the youth. (It is not asserted by the writer that Socrates did corrupt the youth.)_

## Quin

**Rule 23.** Quin with Subjunctive is used
- 1a) after Verbs of doubting and denying¹
- 1b) after Verbs of hindering and preventing²

when these verbs are preceded by a negative.

In these uses quin = qui-ne, _by which not_, qui being an old Ablative of the Relative.

### Examples.

- a) Non dubitare/negare¹ debemus quin fuerint ante Homerum poetae. _We ought not to doubt/deny that there were poets before Homer._
- b) Nihil me deterrebit quin proficiscar. _Nothing will prevent my setting out._

  Haud multum abfuit quin Ismenias interficeretur. _Ismenias was very near being killed. (There was not much to prevent Isemenias being killed.)_

Under (1b) come to the important phrases:
- non possum facere quin... = _I cannot help..._
- non potest fieri quin... = _It is impossible that... not..._
- haud multum abfuit quin (ego)... = _I was very near..._ or _I was not far from..._

- (2) In certain phrases where quin = qui-ne, _who not_, qui being Nominative.

e.g.
- Nemo est quin... nulla navis est quin... etc.
- Nullum est aedificium quin collapsum sit. _There is not building that has not fallen._

N.B. In all its uses quin is preceded by a negative, or virtual negative (e.g. vix, aegre, or a question expecting the answer "no," like "Can anyone prevent...?")

¹ The use of this construction with negare is not earlier than Livy.

² Prohibeo, veto, prefer Infinitive.

## Quominus

**Rule 24.** Quominus with Subjunctive is used after verbs of hindering and preventing, whether they are positive or negative.¹

Exception. Prohibeo, veto, prefer an Infinitive.

### Examples

- Nihil deterret sapientem quominus reipublicae consulat. _Nothing prevents a philosopher from serving the state._
- Per Africanum stetit quominus dimicaretur. _It was due to Africanus that there was no battle._

¹ Quominus = quo minus, and is really a special case of the Relative with the Subj. making a Final sentence.

## Temporal Clauses

**Rule 25.** Conjunctions used in a purely temporal sense are followed by the indicative. But the verb is put in the Subjunctive (a) when it is in Oratio Obliqua, (b) when some other idea than that of time (e.g. purpose) is introduced. 

N.B. Quum is an exception. Also dum in the sense of while. For these see Rules 26, 27.

### Examples

(a) Postquam¹ omnes Belgarum copias ad se venire vidit, ad exercitum properavit. _After he saw that all the forces of the Belgians were coming to him he hastened to join the army.
_
(3) Caesar priusquam se hostes ex terrore reciperent in fines Suessionum exercitum duxit. _Before the enemy could recover² from their panic, Caesar led his army into the territories of the Suessiones._

When the temporal clause refers to Future time the verb will be in the Future (or Fut. Perf.) in Latin, though in English the Present is preferred.

(c) Nos ante abibimus quam tu redieris (Fut. Perf.). _We shall go away before you return._

¹ 1 The English Pluperfect should be rendered by Latin Perfect after postquam, and simulac. But with postquam the Plup. may be used if the exact interval of time is mentioned. Tertio post anno quam veneram = three years after I had, come.

² Implying that Caesar wished to prevent their recovering.

## Quum

**Rule 26.**
- Quum (= when)
  - in Primary tenses takes Indicative.
   in Historic tenses takes Subjunctive.
 - (= since/although) always Subjunctive.

### Examples.

- (a) Quum potero reddam. _I will pay it back when I can._
- (b) Quae quum cognoscerent, se recipere in animo habebant. _when/since/although they learnt this, they intended to retreat._

### Exceptions.

Quum (= when) may take Historic tenses of the Indicative in certain cases-

1. When the clauses are inverted, i.e. when the quum clause really contains the principal statement.

  e.g. Jam ver appetebat quum Hannibal ex hibernis movit. _Spring was already approaching when Hannibal mored from his winter quarters._
  
  N.B. If not inverted, this wonld be "Hannibal moved from his quarters when spring was approaching"(quum ver appeteret).

2. When quum is frequentative, i.e. is equal to quoties, _as often as_, _whenever_. [In this sense use Perfect and Pluperfect.]

  e.g. Quum consul abfuerat, seditiosi erant. _They were mutinous whenever the consul was absent._

3. When quum is equal to quamdiu, _as long as_, or _ex quo tempore_, _since_.

  e.g. Quum consul aberat tum seditiosi erant. _They were mutinous as long as the consul was away._

## Dum

**Rule 27.** Dum 
- (= while¹) may take Present Indicative, even of Past Time and in Oratio Obliqua.
- (= provided that, if only = dummodo) always Subjunctive.
- (= until) follows ordinary rule of Temporal Conjunctions (Rule 25).

- Dum arma conquiruntur circiter hominum millia sex ad Rhenum contenderunt. _While the arms were being searched for about 6000 made off for the Rhine._
- Oderint dum metuant. _Let them hate provided that they fear._
- Dum reliquae naves convenirent ad horam nonam exspectavit. _To allow the rest of the ships to assemble, he waited till the ninth hour._
- Mansit dum judices rejecti sunt. _He waited till the judges were rejected._

¹ But when 'while' can be turned by 'as long as,' dum may take any tense of the Indicative, like quamdiu, etc. See Rule 25. e.g. Haec feci dum licuit = _I did this while (as long as) I was allowed_.

The difference is that in this case the time of the action of the principal verb and the time of the action of the 'dum' verb are contemporaneous, i.e. begin and end together.

## Quum and Dum

## Conditional Sentences

**Rule 28.**

- A. Open Conditions, i.e. those in which we assume the condition without implying anything as to its fulfilment.

  INDICATIVE in both clauses. Any tense possible according to the sense.

  - Si hoc facis, peccas. _If you do this you do wrong._
  - Si hoc facies/feceris peccabis. _If you do this (Fut.) you will do wrong._
  - Si hoc fecisti peccavisti. _If you did this you did wrong._

- B. Conditions in which it is implied that the fulfilment of the condition is improbable but possible.

  PRESENT (or PERFECT) SUBJUNCTIVE in both clauses.

  - Si hoc facias, pecces. If you did/were to do this you would do wrong.

- C. Impossible Conditions, i.e. those in which it is implied that the fulfilment of the condition is impossible.

  1. Relating to Present time, or to continuous action in Past time.
  
     IMPERFECT SUBJUNCTIVE in both clauses.

     Si hoc faceres, peccares. _If you were doing this, you would be doing wrong._ (implying "_but you are not doing it._")
     or, _If you had been doing this you would have been doing wrong._

  2. Relating to Past time.
 
     PLUPERFECT SUBJUNCTIVE in both clauses.

     Si hoc fecisses, peccavisses. _If you had done this, you would have done wrong._ (implying "_But you did not do it._")

The tense and mood are generally the same in the protasis (i.e. the if clause) and the apodosis (i.e. the conclusion). But in C the condition may obviously relate to past time and so be Pluperfect, while the conclusion relates to present time and is therefore Imperfect.¹

e.g. Si hoc fecisses, nunc felix esses. _If you had done this you would now be happy._

The apodosis need not always be a statement, but may be a command or wish, e.g. Ne veneris nisi jussero. Moriar si me facti poenitet.

The English Present is often used for what is really a Future action. In Latin the Future or Fut. Perf. must always be used in these cases, e.g. Si id feceris (or facies) peccabis = '_If you do this you will do wrong._'

### Further Examples of Conditionals

- A.
  - Parvi sunt foris arma nisi est consilium domi. _Arms are worth little abroad unless there is wisdom at home._
  - Si te hie offendero, moriere. _If I meet you here, you shall die._
  - Non si tibi ante profuit, semper proderit. _If it helped you before it will not help you always._
- B.
  - Nonne sapiens, si fame conficiatur, abstulerit cibum alteri? _Would not a wise man, if he were being starved, take food from another?_
- C.
  - Non pacem peterem nisi utilem crederem. _I should not be asking for peace if I did not think it advantageous._
  - Si Camillus tale fecisset, non nobis exemplo esset. _Had Camillus done such a thing, he would not be an example to us._

¹ Moreover, in Impossible Conditions, if the verb of the apodosis is possum, debeo, oportet, or a gerundive (or any verb expressing obligation or possibility), it is regularly put in the Indicative.

e.g. Si patriam perdidisset interficiendus erat. _If he had betrayed his country he should have been put to death._

## Pronouns and Adverbs

### TRANSLATION OF 'ANY.'

- Quisquam (adj. ullus) to be used when 'any' is exclusive ; i.e. with negatives and sentences virtually negative. Sentences are virtually negative (1) when they contain vix, aegre, sine, (2) when they are questions expecting the answer 'no,' (3) when they are conparative, "he was taller than any of his friends."
- Quivis, Quilibet to be used when 'any' is inclusive; i.e. when it means anybody like you, or everybody.
- Quis (adj. qui) only used after si, nisi, num, ne (and after quo, quanto, with comparatives).
- Aliquis only when someone may be substituted for anyone in the English without altering the sense.

### TRANSLATION OF 'SOME.'

- Aliquis and Quispiam are the ordinary words.
  aliquis should be used for 'somebody,' when it means 'a person of consequence.'
- Quidam = a certain man, almost the Eng. Indefinite Article. As a rule it follows its noun.
- Nescio quis = some one or other, no definite person indicated.
- Alii ... alii = some ... others.
- Nonnulli = some, of number, opposed to none, and often implying a considerable number.
- Aliquot = some, of number.

### Examples.

- Quivis de virtute loquitur, vix quisquam virtutem praestat. _Everyone talks about virtue, scarcely anyone practises it._
- Si quid cognovisti, loquere. _If you have learnt anything, speak._
- Forsitan dicat aliquis... _Perhaps some one may say..._
- Hic nescio quis loquitur. _There is someone or other talking here._

### OTHER PRONOUNS.

- Quisquis, whoever (adj. quicunque).
- Ecquis? Interrog. and Indef. combined,-'anyone at all'?
- Quisnam? = the Interrog. quis.
- Quisque, each man.

Its commonest uses are with superlatives and ordinals; e.g. optimus quisque (all the best men), decimus quisque (every tenth man, or one in ten), and in combination with suus or ipse; e.g. suam quisque  salutem petit (each man seeks his own safety).

### ADVERBS

- Unquam (ever) and usquam (anywhere) can only be used according to the rule of quisquam; i.e. with negatives and virtual negatives.
- Quo (anywhither), quando (at any time), in the same way correspond to quis.
- e.g. Si quando peccaveris, ne celaveris unquam. _If ever you sin, never conceal it._

Contrast Ne semper celaveris = _Do not be ever/always concealing it._

- Alicubi (somewhere), aliquando (some time, once upon a time), aliquantum (some quantity), aliquamdiu (for some time), correspond to aliquis. The syllable ali always corresponds to the Eng. some, and these words must not be used for the Eng. any, except when it stands for some.
- Nonnunquam (sometimes) corresponds to nonnulli.

## Concessive Clauses

**Rule 29.** Concessive Clauses have their verb (a) in the Indicative when what is conceded is allowed to be a fact; (b) in the Subjunctive if it is only conceded as a hypothesis for argument's sake.

- Quamvis, licet, quum, ut are only to be used with SUBJUNCTIVE.
- Quanquam is only to be used with INDICATIVE.
- Eisi, etiamsi, tametsi may be used with either according to meaning.

### Examples.

- (a)
  - Romani quanquam fessi erant procedunt. _The Romans advanced in spite of being tired._
  - Cur nolint, etiamsi tacent, satis dicunt. _Though they are silent they show clearly why they are unwilling._
- (b)
  - Quod turpe est, id, quamvis occultetur, tamen honestum fieri nullo modo potest. _What is base cannot be made honourable, however much it be disguised._
  - Rectum est, etiamsi nobis indigna audiamus, iracundiam repellere. _It is right to restrain our passions, even though we should hear things that we resent (things unworthy of us)._

## Comparative Clauses

**Rule 30.** When the Comparative Clause is meant to state an actual fact its verb is in the Indicative; but when it is a purely imaginary comparison the verb is in the Subjunctive.

In the first case the commonest words of comparison used are: sicut (just as), perinde ac (exactly as), aeque ac (as much as), aliter ac (otherwise than), alius ac (different from), idem ac (the same as).

In the second case the commonest are : velut, quasi, tanquam (si).

### Examples.

- Poenas dedit sicut meritus est. _He was punished as he deserved._
- Absentis Ariovisti crudelitatem quasi coram adesset horrebant. _They dreaded the cruelty of Ariovistus in his absence just as if he had been present._
- Virtus eadem in homine ac deo est. _Virtue is the same in man as in God._

## Oratio Obliqua

**Rule 31.** In Latin it is much commoner than in English to report a long speech not in the exact words of the speaker, but in the Indirect form, or Oratio Obliqua. Each clause in this will be either an Indirect Statement, or an Indirect Command, or an Indirect Question, or a clause dependent on one of these; and the mood and tense must be determined by the rules already given.¹

But observe-
1. The Oratio Obliqua being continuous, the verb of "saying" which introduces it is not to be repeated before each clause, and a verb of command or questioning may be understood from one of saying and vice versa.
2. Where a command comes in the middle of Oratio Obliqua the ut is not expressed, though if it is a prohibition the ne must be expressed.
3. Questions in Oratio Obliqua may be expressed by the Infinitive when they are asked for rhetorical purposes, and not to obtain an answer, and are practically equivalent to negative statements. Questions which in the direct form are in the 1st or 3rd Person are generally rhetorical.

  e.g. the following are rhetorical questions: "_Am I a coward that I should fly without striking a blow?_" "_Is freedom a possession to be lightly esteemed?_" (Num libertatem parvi aestimandam esse?)

4. All pronouns representing the 1st and 2nd Persons must be changed into the 3rd Person.

  e.g. 
  - ego, meus, nos, noster, become se, suus.²
  - tu, tuus, vos, vester, become ille, illius, is, ejus, etc.
  - hic and iste become ille and is.

  Adverbs require similar changes:
  - hodie becomes illo die.
  - hic becomes ibi.
  - nunc becomes jam or tunc.

  The following example will illustrate these points:
  
  "_The general asked his men why they hesitated, and urged them to advance at once. He reminded them that everything depended on their bravery, and declared that if they shirked the battle they would disgrace him and their country. Was it credible, he demanded, that he was addressing the same men who had so often defeated the enemy?_"

"Imperator suos interrogavit cur haesitarent : statim progrederentur, omnia enim in illorum virtute esse posita; quodsi pugnam detrectassent illos dedecori fore et sibi et patriae. Num credibile esse se eosden adloqui qui hostem toties vicissent?"

Notice here that the English verbs "urged," "reminded," "declared," "demanded," are all understood in Latin from the one introductory word "interrogavit"; that the command "progrederentur" is expressed without the ut; and that the Infinitive "esse" represents a rhetorical question.

Notice also that the Pluperfect "detrectassent" stands for the Future Perfect of the Direct Speech.

| Oratio Recta | Oratio Obliqua | English |
|--------------|----------------|---------|
| Quod si veteris contumeliae oblivisci vellem, num etiam recentium injuriarum, quod me invito iter per provinciam per vim tentavistis, memoriam deponere possum? | His Caesar ita respondit: Quod si veteris contumeliae oblivisci vellet, num etiam recentium injuriarum, quod se invito iter per provinciam per vim tentavissent, memoriam deponere posse? | But if I were willing to forget the old insult, can I also put aside the memory of more recent wrongs, inasmuch as against my will you forced a way through the Roman province? |

N.B. Here, as the form of the conditional si vellet shows, the infinitive posse implies negation, and the question is rhetorical.

| Oratio Recta | Oratio Obliqua | English |
|--------------|----------------|---------|
| Ariovistus me consule cupidissime populi Romani amicitiam appetiit: cur hunc tam temere quisquam ab officio discessurum judicat ? Mihi quidem persuadetur, cognitis meis postulatis, eum neque meam neque populi Romani gratiam repudiaturum. Quod si furore atque amentia impulsus bellum intulerit, quid tandem veremini? aut cur de nostra virtute aut de mea diligentia desperatis? | Dixit-Ariovistum se consule cupidissime populi Romani amicitiam appetisse: cur illum tam temere quisquam ab officio discessurum judicaret ? Sibi quidem persuaderi, cognitis suis postulatis, eum neque suam neque populi Romani gratiam repudiaturum. Quod si furore atque amentia impulsus bellum intulisset, quid tandem vererentur? aut cur de sua virtute aut de ipsius diligentia desperarent? | During my consulship Ariovistus most earnestly coveted the friendship of the Roman people. Why does anyone suppose that he will so hastily cast off his allegiance? For my part I am convinced that when he is acquainted with my demands he will not slight either my favour or that of the Roman people. But if under the impulse of rage and madness he does wage war upon us, why, I ask, are you afraid ? or why do you doubt either our courage or my diligence? |
| Si pacem populus Romanus cum Helvetiis faciet, in eam partem ibunt atque ibi erunt Helvetii ubi eos constituisti; sin bello perscqui perseverabis, reminiscere veteris incommodi populi Romani. Quod improviso unum pagum adortus es cum ii, qui flumen transierant suis auxilium ferre non possent, ne ob hanc rem tuae magnopere virtuti tribueris neve nos despexeris. | Is ita cum Caesare egit: si pacem populus Romanus cum Helvetiis faceret, in eam partem ituros atque ibi futuros Helvetios, ubi eos Caesar constituisset; sin bello persequi perseveraret, reminisceretur veteris incommodi populi Romani. Quod improviso unum pagum adortus esset cum ii, qui flumen transiis sent, suis auxilium ferre non possent, ne ob eam rem suae magnopere virtuti tribueret, neve se ipsos despiceret. | If the people of Rome make peace with the Helvetii, the Helvetii will go to that part of the country which you have assigned to them, and will remain there. But should you persist in harrying them with war-remember the former disaster which befell the Roman people. As to the fact of your having fallen unexpectedly upon a single canton, when those who had crossed the river could not bring help to their friends, do not on this account think too highly of your own valour, or treat us with scorn.
