## Sequence of tenses

**Rule I.** The tenses in Latin are divided into two groups:

| Group | Indicative | Subjunctive |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| A. Primary tenses | Present. <br>Future. <br>Perfect with “have.” | Present. <br>Perfect. |
| B. Historic tenses | Imperfect. <br>Perfect without “have.” (Aorist.)  <br>Pluperfect. | Imperfect. <br>Pluperfect. |

Where we have a dependent sentence with its verb in the Subjunctive, the tense of the Subjunctive is determined by the tense of the principal verb. Primary tenses follow Primary, Historic tenses follow Historic.[^1]

The English will generally make it quite clear which of the two Primary tenses, or which of the two Historic tenses, is required in each case.

## Exercise 1.

In the following sentences Latin requires the dependent verb to be in the Subjunctive. Say (without translating) what tense you would put it in.

1. They have come in order that they may conquer us.
2. They sent money that we might buy our freedom.
3. We had already succeeded so well that we hoped to win.
4. We are so tired that we cannot work.
5. He ran so quickly that no one could catch him.
6. We do not know what he is doing.
7. Have you heard what he has done?
8. They did not know what the island was like.
9. We shall ask what he is doing.
10. We asked whether the war had been finished.
11. I do not know how many ships there were.
12. We were wondering why you feared us.
13. Tell me why you are afraid.
14. We shall work in order that we may become rich.

## Final Sentences

**Rule 2.** Final Sentences (i.e. sentences expressing a *purpose*) have their verbs in the Subjunctive, introduced by *ut* when positive, by *ne* when negative.

### Examples

- Laborant pauperes **ut** divites **fiant**.

  *Poor men work to become rich.*

- Se receperunt **ne** consilia ab hostibus **cognoscerentur**.

The Greeks valued their liberty so highly that they determined to resist the Persians and never' yield to them. Themistocles was put in command of the Greek forces. By his advice the Greeks trusted to their ships, and fought the Persians2 by sea. The Greek fleet was near the island of Salainis,8 and most of the leaders wished to withdraw from this place, and leave Athens in the hands of the Persians; for they valued their own safety more than the city of Athens. Then Themistocles declared that he and the Athenians4 would sail to Athens with the fleet of two hundred ships. But he was not able to persuade the others

## Exercise 64 [A].

Thereupon5 Themistocles formed the following6 plan to save both Athens and the other States of Greece. He sent a messenger secretly to the king of the Persians to tell him that the Greeks were about to depart. He pointed out that the Persians with their large fleet would easily surround the small forces of the Greeks. There are some who' say that by this advice he wished to please the king, and that he put his own safety before the freedom of his country. But the advice was of great service to Greece; for the ships of the Persians hindered one another,8 and the Greeks routed the enemy.

## Exercise 65 [A].

In the battle which Caesar fought in that place with the Gauls he lost many of his men. For when he had arrived at the top of a hill, and had begun to fortify a camp, suddenly the enemy made an attack. The Romans, who were not standing in line of battle, at first were unable to resist, and took to flight; but afterwards Caesar sent the tenth legion, which he had with him,1 to their aid, and at last the Gauls were driven down to the river. Here, however, they again made a stand, and Caesar himself says that they fought very bravely.

## Exercise 66 [A].

When the king was told of this, he sent an officer2 with 150 soldiers to take the robbers and bring them to him. On arriving at the place where the robbers were, they found that a very strong camp had been made in a wood, and that all the approaches had been blocked by cutting down trees.3 At length, however, the place was storined, and the robbers being taken were put to death but the king pardoned the leader's son, a boy twelve years old.

## Exercise 67 [B].

When the crops began to ripen the general marched through the wood, making use of1 a guide whom his horsemen had taken prisoner. On his march he sent out scouts to discover the enemy's camp. They having returned informed him that the enemy with their wives and children and a large number of cattle had made a camp in the middle of the marsh, and were awaiting his arrival. When he learnt this he advanced so quickly that he reached their camp at midnight; and such was the bravery of the Romans that few of the Germans escaped in safety.

## Exercise 68 [B].

Calenus received a letter from Caesar, who told him that all the harbours and the shore were held by the enemy. On hearing this he recalled all his ships; but one of them, which did not obey liis orders, was captured by Bibulus. All the sailors were put to death by the cruel general; he spared neither man nor boy, and hoped by his cruelty to finish the war more quickly. But Calenus pursued his fleet with 40 ships, and defeated him at Oricum three days after the massacre.

## Exercise 69 [B].

The kings of England and Germany declared war against Philip,1 king of France. They felt sure that they would conquer him, on account of the number2 of their troops, and because they held the French forces in small esteem. Nevertheless he defeated them in a great battle at Bovinium. It was a desperate battle,3 and all showed the greatest bravery. It was observed that a certain priest had killed great numbers? of the enemy. The weapon which he used was an iron club. He had chosen this because he declared that a priest ought not to shed human blood,4 and by this means his enemies died from the violence of the blow.

## Exercise 70 [B].

The French king himself was the bravest knight in his army. He himself was wounded, and his horse was killed under him; but he rose immediately, and led his men again against the enemy. They charged a squadron of Germans, amongst whom was the emperor himself. The Germans, thinking5 that their emperor would be taken prisoner, came up to his help, and opened for him a way of escape. Thereupon Philip remarked to his men that they would only see the emperor's back on that day. After the flight of the emperor the French pursued his army, and defeated them with great slaughter.

## Exercise 81 [A]

In the evening a spy was caught by the guards at the gate of the town. Being brought to the commander of the garrison he fell down, and besought him with tears to spare him. He said he could persuade many of the besieging army to desert, and promised to assassinate their general. But the commander said he did not wage war in that way; and he ordered the guards to conduct the man to the enemy’s camp. At the same time he sent a letter to the general, in which he advised him not to make use of traitors again—for (said he) they are always willing to betray their masters to save their own lives.

## Exercise 82 [B]

After this battle the Spartan commander sent a messenger to Sparta to tell the citizens that their good fortune had been lost, Mindarus slain, and that the soldiers were dying of starvation.

At length the Athenians, being compelled by famine, surrendered their city, and became allies of the Spartans.

On the next day the English advanced by forced marches with the intention of attacking the French off their guard.

But the French general told his men not to fire back, but to allow the English to approach the bottom of the mound.

Then when the signal was given the French charged with such force that the English were routed and took to flight.

Eurystheus then set Hercules the eleventh labour, which was harder than those which we have mentioned above. For he ordered him to take away the golden apples from the gardens of the Hesperides. These were nymphs of remarkable beauty, who lived in a distant land, and some golden apples had been entrusted to them by Juno. Many men had before this tried to take away these apples; but it was a difficult thing to do, for the garden in which the apples were was surrounded by a high wall on all sides. Moreover a dragon, which had a hundred heads, guarded the gate of the garden carefully by day and night.

## Exercise 93 [A]

Hearing that the Belgae were conspiring against the Romans, Caesar determined to go himself without delay to central Gaul with two legions, ordering the rest to follow in a few days.

They said that the rest of the Belgae were under arms, and that the Germans had joined them. On hearing this, Caesar promised to come with all possible speed to the help of the Remi, that having joined their forces they might repel the invasion of the Germans.

But when the enemy perceived that they had not been able to attack our men off their guard, the signal for retreat was given, and they withdrew.

## Exercise 95 [B]

Louis could not at this time besiege Tunis, because he had not received reinforcements from his brother Charles, King of Sicily; and meanwhile his army was attacked by a disease which carried off the greater part of his soldiers in a few days. The king himself was seized with the disease, and felt that he would die of it. But, to sustain the courage of his soldiers, he performed all the duties of a king, and attended in every way to the safety of the camp. But at last he was compelled to remain within his tent, and before long² died, after telling his men never to abandon the siege.

## Exercise 96 [B]

Nothing had been heard of the army for many months, and the citizens began to think that it had been defeated and all their fellow‑countrymen killed. The women used to go every day to the temples, and pray the gods to send them back safely their husbands and sons. At last, when winter was approaching, and all had begun to give up hope, a messenger was seen at a distance who was approaching the city with great speed. The citizens all rushed out to meet him, and implored him to tell them without delay about the army. So tired was the messenger by his journey that at first he could not speak; but at length he said that the army had both won many victories and taken many towns of the enemy, and that the soldiers hoped in a short time to return home with a great quantity of booty and many prisoners.

## Exercise 97 [B]

As the people of Veii often made incursions for the sake of plunder, the Romans were scarcely able to defend their own territories. Their soldiers went home to their fields in the spring to sow, and in the autumn to gather the harvest, at which times the Veientines did a great deal of harm to their lands. At last the Fabii promised the Senate that they would be under arms the whole year, and undertake the whole war themselves. The Senate thanked them, and going out from Rome they made a camp near the river Cremera. For a little time they checked the Veientines, but at length they were surrounded, and slaughtered to a man.

## Exercise 98 [B]

We set out from Moscow about the third watch, so that no disturbance might be excited by our friends. I never expected to see my brothers again. For thirty‑three days we marched along a road covered by snow a foot deep. Sometimes one of us fell down, and was unable to move further. Our guards did not try to urge him on, for they knew well that the wolves would have him for their prey before the next day. I now often envy those who were thus left on the road, and prefer death to the evils which daily press upon me. I am compelled to work, but that is the least of my ills; I am compelled to see the sufferings of the women who with us dared everything for the sake of liberty.

## Exercise 106 [A]

Our men saw that they were surrounded on all sides; and no opportunity being left for retreating, they resolved to charge with all their might in the hope of striking terror into the enemy. They knew that they had been brought into these dangers by delaying too long before, and they hoped that by fighting bravely now they would force the enemy to give ground. Therefore, when the signal for advance was given, they ran forward with a loud shout against that part of the line which seemed weakest. The enemy were thrown into such confusion by this unexpected attack that their line was broken at once, and no one resisted our charge.

## Exercise 107 [A]

A messenger had been sent to France to ask for help, and to invite French troops to Ireland. Arms and money were promised for the purpose of assisting an Irish army. These were conveyed by a French ship, and a hundred men assembled on the shore to receive the arms which it was going to land. But in a storm two of their boats had been broken, and in repairing them time was wasted. Meanwhile, to scatter the rebels, a troop of horse had been sent out from Cork, at the sight of whom the rebels fled in all directions; and to effect their own escape the French sailors threw the arms overboard; they lie sunk in the harbour to this day.

## Exercise 108 [B]

The French general was unwilling to attack us at close quarters, because his troops were inexperienced in battle, and he thought they would fight best when sheltered by ramparts. Moreover, three years before his troops had been unable to resist the English hand to hand, but having been withdrawn into the town, had defended the walls obstinately. The recollection of that time and the desire to prolong the war induced him to remain where he was. However, in order to give the Belgians an opportunity of deserting us, he sent out troops of cavalry as far as our outposts. But for fear of this we employed no Belgians as sentinels. For throughout the whole year we were expecting every day they would desert us.

## Exercise 109 [B]

The Athenians hoped that a Spartan army would march into Boeotia, and had taken no measures to save their families and property. Therefore they saw with the utmost fear and dismay that the Barbarians were advancing with all their forces for the sake of attacking their city. It was evident that in six days Xerxes would be at Athens, and this seemed a very short time for removing the population of a whole city. But they knew that it was of the greatest importance to them to accomplish this, and before his arrival they had safely removed all who were willing to leave their homes. Some were taken to Aegina, others to Troezen; but many could not be induced to proceed farther than Salamis.

## Exercise 118 [A]

It is said that a certain prophetess brought nine books to Tarquin, king of Rome, and asked him if he wished to buy them. The king asked for what price she was willing to sell them; to which she replied that she would sell them for three hundred pieces of gold. The woman went away, but afterwards she returned with six books. Tarquin asked where she had left the others, and she replied that she had burnt them, but that she would sell him these for the same price. Tarquin would not buy them, and she again left him. But once more she returned with only three books, and asked whether he was willing to buy these at the same price or not.

## Exercise 119 [A]

The king, who wondered why she had returned so often, now asked his senate whether he ought to keep them. They first asked him what sort of books they were, and if the prophetess had shown them to him. The king replied that she had said nothing, but that she had burnt six books out of nine, and now offered three at the same price. It seemed doubtful to the senators what they ought to do, but at last they advised the king to buy the books. Then the woman, having received the money, advised the Romans to keep the books very carefully, and went away.

## Exercise 120 [A]

The story is told of King Tarquin that he once determined to add new companies to the Roman knights. Attius the augur said it could not be done. Moved by anger the king demanded that he should show by a sign what the gods wished. Attius replied that he would tell the king what he had in his mind. But Tarquin said, “Tell me rather whether that which I have in my mind can be done.” “It can be done,” said Attius. Then the king bade him cut a whetstone in two, for he said he was thinking of that. Without any delay (so they relate) Attius cleft it with a razor.
