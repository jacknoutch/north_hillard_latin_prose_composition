## Sequence of tenses

**Rule I.** The tenses in Latin are divided into two groups:

| Group | Indicative | Subjunctive |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| A. Primary tenses | Present. <br>Future. <br>Perfect with “have.” | Present. <br>Perfect. |
| B. Historic tenses | Imperfect. <br>Perfect without “have.” (Aorist.)  <br>Pluperfect. | Imperfect. <br>Pluperfect. |

Where we have a dependent sentence with its verb in the Subjunctive, the tense of the Subjunctive is determined by the tense of the principal verb. Primary tenses follow Primary, Historic tenses follow Historic.[^1]

The English will generally make it quite clear which of the two Primary tenses, or which of the two Historic tenses, is required in each case.

## Exercise 1.

In the following sentences Latin requires the dependent verb to be in the Subjunctive. Say (without translating) what tense you would put it in.

1. They have come in order that they may conquer us.
2. They sent money that we might buy our freedom.
3. We had already succeeded so well that we hoped to win.
4. We are so tired that we cannot work.
5. He ran so quickly that no one could catch him.
6. We do not know what he is doing.
7. Have you heard what he has done?
8. They did not know what the island was like.
9. We shall ask what he is doing.
10. We asked whether the war had been finished.
11. I do not know how many ships there were.
12. We were wondering why you feared us.
13. Tell me why you are afraid.
14. We shall work in order that we may become rich.

## Final Sentences

**Rule 2.** Final Sentences (i.e. sentences expressing a *purpose*) have their verbs in the Subjunctive, introduced by *ut* when positive, by *ne* when negative.

### Examples

- Laborant pauperes **ut** divites **fiant**.

  *Poor men work to become rich.*

- Se receperunt **ne** consilia ab hostibus **cognoscerentur**.

The Greeks valued their liberty so highly that they determined to resist the Persians and never' yield to them. Themistocles was put in command of the Greek forces. By his advice the Greeks trusted to their ships, and fought the Persians2 by sea. The Greek fleet was near the island of Salainis,8 and most of the leaders wished to withdraw from this place, and leave Athens in the hands of the Persians; for they valued their own safety more than the city of Athens. Then Themistocles declared that he and the Athenians4 would sail to Athens with the fleet of two hundred ships. But he was not able to persuade the others

## Exercise 64 [A].

Thereupon5 Themistocles formed the following6 plan to save both Athens and the other States of Greece. He sent a messenger secretly to the king of the Persians to tell him that the Greeks were about to depart. He pointed out that the Persians with their large fleet would easily surround the small forces of the Greeks. There are some who' say that by this advice he wished to please the king, and that he put his own safety before the freedom of his country. But the advice was of great service to Greece; for the ships of the Persians hindered one another,8 and the Greeks routed the enemy.

## Exercise 65 [A].

In the battle which Caesar fought in that place with the Gauls he lost many of his men. For when he had arrived at the top of a hill, and had begun to fortify a camp, suddenly the enemy made an attack. The Romans, who were not standing in line of battle, at first were unable to resist, and took to flight; but afterwards Caesar sent the tenth legion, which he had with him,1 to their aid, and at last the Gauls were driven down to the river. Here, however, they again made a stand, and Caesar himself says that they fought very bravely.

## Exercise 66 [A].

When the king was told of this, he sent an officer2 with 150 soldiers to take the robbers and bring them to him. On arriving at the place where the robbers were, they found that a very strong camp had been made in a wood, and that all the approaches had been blocked by cutting down trees.3 At length, however, the place was storined, and the robbers being taken were put to death but the king pardoned the leader's son, a boy twelve years old.

## Exercise 67 [B].

When the crops began to ripen the general marched through the wood, making use of1 a guide whom his horsemen had taken prisoner. On his march he sent out scouts to discover the enemy's camp. They having returned informed him that the enemy with their wives and children and a large number of cattle had made a camp in the middle of the marsh, and were awaiting his arrival. When he learnt this he advanced so quickly that he reached their camp at midnight; and such was the bravery of the Romans that few of the Germans escaped in safety.

## Exercise 68 [B].

Calenus received a letter from Caesar, who told him that all the harbours and the shore were held by the enemy. On hearing this he recalled all his ships; but one of them, which did not obey liis orders, was captured by Bibulus. All the sailors were put to death by the cruel general; he spared neither man nor boy, and hoped by his cruelty to finish the war more quickly. But Calenus pursued his fleet with 40 ships, and defeated him at Oricum three days after the massacre.

## Exercise 69 [B].

The kings of England and Germany declared war against Philip,1 king of France. They felt sure that they would conquer him, on account of the number2 of their troops, and because they held the French forces in small esteem. Nevertheless he defeated them in a great battle at Bovinium. It was a desperate battle,3 and all showed the greatest bravery. It was observed that a certain priest had killed great numbers? of the enemy. The weapon which he used was an iron club. He had chosen this because he declared that a priest ought not to shed human blood,4 and by this means his enemies died from the violence of the blow.

## Exercise 70 [B].

The French king himself was the bravest knight in his army. He himself was wounded, and his horse was killed under him; but he rose immediately, and led his men again against the enemy. They charged a squadron of Germans, amongst whom was the emperor himself. The Germans, thinking5 that their emperor would be taken prisoner, came up to his help, and opened for him a way of escape. Thereupon Philip remarked to his men that they would only see the emperor's back on that day. After the flight of the emperor the French pursued his army, and defeated them with great slaughter.

## Exercise 81 [A]

In the evening a spy was caught by the guards at the gate of the town. Being brought to the commander of the garrison he fell down, and besought him with tears to spare him. He said he could persuade many of the besieging army to desert, and promised to assassinate their general. But the commander said he did not wage war in that way; and he ordered the guards to conduct the man to the enemy’s camp. At the same time he sent a letter to the general, in which he advised him not to make use of traitors again—for (said he) they are always willing to betray their masters to save their own lives.

## Exercise 82 [B]

After this battle the Spartan commander sent a messenger to Sparta to tell the citizens that their good fortune had been lost, Mindarus slain, and that the soldiers were dying of starvation.

At length the Athenians, being compelled by famine, surrendered their city, and became allies of the Spartans.

On the next day the English advanced by forced marches with the intention of attacking the French off their guard.

But the French general told his men not to fire back, but to allow the English to approach the bottom of the mound.

Then when the signal was given the French charged with such force that the English were routed and took to flight.

Eurystheus then set Hercules the eleventh labour, which was harder than those which we have mentioned above. For he ordered him to take away the golden apples from the gardens of the Hesperides. These were nymphs of remarkable beauty, who lived in a distant land, and some golden apples had been entrusted to them by Juno. Many men had before this tried to take away these apples; but it was a difficult thing to do, for the garden in which the apples were was surrounded by a high wall on all sides. Moreover a dragon, which had a hundred heads, guarded the gate of the garden carefully by day and night.

## Exercise 93 [A]

Hearing that the Belgae were conspiring against the Romans, Caesar determined to go himself without delay to central Gaul with two legions, ordering the rest to follow in a few days.

They said that the rest of the Belgae were under arms, and that the Germans had joined them. On hearing this, Caesar promised to come with all possible speed to the help of the Remi, that having joined their forces they might repel the invasion of the Germans.

But when the enemy perceived that they had not been able to attack our men off their guard, the signal for retreat was given, and they withdrew.

## Exercise 95 [B]

Louis could not at this time besiege Tunis, because he had not received reinforcements from his brother Charles, King of Sicily; and meanwhile his army was attacked by a disease which carried off the greater part of his soldiers in a few days. The king himself was seized with the disease, and felt that he would die of it. But, to sustain the courage of his soldiers, he performed all the duties of a king, and attended in every way to the safety of the camp. But at last he was compelled to remain within his tent, and before long² died, after telling his men never to abandon the siege.

## Exercise 96 [B]

Nothing had been heard of the army for many months, and the citizens began to think that it had been defeated and all their fellow‑countrymen killed. The women used to go every day to the temples, and pray the gods to send them back safely their husbands and sons. At last, when winter was approaching, and all had begun to give up hope, a messenger was seen at a distance who was approaching the city with great speed. The citizens all rushed out to meet him, and implored him to tell them without delay about the army. So tired was the messenger by his journey that at first he could not speak; but at length he said that the army had both won many victories and taken many towns of the enemy, and that the soldiers hoped in a short time to return home with a great quantity of booty and many prisoners.

## Exercise 97 [B]

As the people of Veii often made incursions for the sake of plunder, the Romans were scarcely able to defend their own territories. Their soldiers went home to their fields in the spring to sow, and in the autumn to gather the harvest, at which times the Veientines did a great deal of harm to their lands. At last the Fabii promised the Senate that they would be under arms the whole year, and undertake the whole war themselves. The Senate thanked them, and going out from Rome they made a camp near the river Cremera. For a little time they checked the Veientines, but at length they were surrounded, and slaughtered to a man.

## Exercise 98 [B]

We set out from Moscow about the third watch, so that no disturbance might be excited by our friends. I never expected to see my brothers again. For thirty‑three days we marched along a road covered by snow a foot deep. Sometimes one of us fell down, and was unable to move further. Our guards did not try to urge him on, for they knew well that the wolves would have him for their prey before the next day. I now often envy those who were thus left on the road, and prefer death to the evils which daily press upon me. I am compelled to work, but that is the least of my ills; I am compelled to see the sufferings of the women who with us dared everything for the sake of liberty.

## Exercise 106 [A]

Our men saw that they were surrounded on all sides; and no opportunity being left for retreating, they resolved to charge with all their might in the hope of striking terror into the enemy. They knew that they had been brought into these dangers by delaying too long before, and they hoped that by fighting bravely now they would force the enemy to give ground. Therefore, when the signal for advance was given, they ran forward with a loud shout against that part of the line which seemed weakest. The enemy were thrown into such confusion by this unexpected attack that their line was broken at once, and no one resisted our charge.

## Exercise 107 [A]

A messenger had been sent to France to ask for help, and to invite French troops to Ireland. Arms and money were promised for the purpose of assisting an Irish army. These were conveyed by a French ship, and a hundred men assembled on the shore to receive the arms which it was going to land. But in a storm two of their boats had been broken, and in repairing them time was wasted. Meanwhile, to scatter the rebels, a troop of horse had been sent out from Cork, at the sight of whom the rebels fled in all directions; and to effect their own escape the French sailors threw the arms overboard; they lie sunk in the harbour to this day.

## Exercise 108 [B]

The French general was unwilling to attack us at close quarters, because his troops were inexperienced in battle, and he thought they would fight best when sheltered by ramparts. Moreover, three years before his troops had been unable to resist the English hand to hand, but having been withdrawn into the town, had defended the walls obstinately. The recollection of that time and the desire to prolong the war induced him to remain where he was. However, in order to give the Belgians an opportunity of deserting us, he sent out troops of cavalry as far as our outposts. But for fear of this we employed no Belgians as sentinels. For throughout the whole year we were expecting every day they would desert us.

## Exercise 109 [B]

The Athenians hoped that a Spartan army would march into Boeotia, and had taken no measures to save their families and property. Therefore they saw with the utmost fear and dismay that the Barbarians were advancing with all their forces for the sake of attacking their city. It was evident that in six days Xerxes would be at Athens, and this seemed a very short time for removing the population of a whole city. But they knew that it was of the greatest importance to them to accomplish this, and before his arrival they had safely removed all who were willing to leave their homes. Some were taken to Aegina, others to Troezen; but many could not be induced to proceed farther than Salamis.

## Exercise 118 [A]

It is said that a certain prophetess brought nine books to Tarquin, king of Rome, and asked him if he wished to buy them. The king asked for what price she was willing to sell them; to which she replied that she would sell them for three hundred pieces of gold. The woman went away, but afterwards she returned with six books. Tarquin asked where she had left the others, and she replied that she had burnt them, but that she would sell him these for the same price. Tarquin would not buy them, and she again left him. But once more she returned with only three books, and asked whether he was willing to buy these at the same price or not.

## Exercise 119 [A]

The king, who wondered why she had returned so often, now asked his senate whether he ought to keep them. They first asked him what sort of books they were, and if the prophetess had shown them to him. The king replied that she had said nothing, but that she had burnt six books out of nine, and now offered three at the same price. It seemed doubtful to the senators what they ought to do, but at last they advised the king to buy the books. Then the woman, having received the money, advised the Romans to keep the books very carefully, and went away.

## Exercise 120 [A]

The story is told of King Tarquin that he once determined to add new companies to the Roman knights. Attius the augur said it could not be done. Moved by anger the king demanded that he should show by a sign what the gods wished. Attius replied that he would tell the king what he had in his mind. But Tarquin said, “Tell me rather whether that which I have in my mind can be done.” “It can be done,” said Attius. Then the king bade him cut a whetstone in two, for he said he was thinking of that. Without any delay (so they relate) Attius cleft it with a razor.

## Exercise 121 [B]

In the following year Cleon was sent to Macedonia to recover the cities which had been taken by the Spartans. He first marched to Amphipolis, and encamped on rising ground near the city. In the meanwhile Brasidas, the Spartan general, who knew what sort of man Cleon was, resolved to deceive him by a trick. He ordered his men not to show themselves on the wall, but to conceal themselves behind the ramparts. Meanwhile he sent out spies to discover how large the forces of Cleon were, and if reinforcements were coming. These men brought back word that the army of the enemy was small, and was not drawn up carefully. Then Brasidas ordered his men to throw open the gates and attack the enemy at once. The Athenians, who did not trust their general, took to flight, and most of them were killed.

## Exercise 122 [B]

The prisoner was brought before the king, who asked him where he had concealed his money. To this the man replied that he had indeed been rich once, but that now all his money had been taken away from him by the soldiers, and that nothing was left. The king asked the soldiers if this was true, but they all declared that they had not taken the gold, and did not know where the prisoner kept it. Then the king said that he would discover by means of tortures who was telling the truth; but the prisoner, being overcome by fear, asked if the king would pardon him when the money was given up. The king promised to do this, whereupon the prisoner said he would show them at once where he had carried the money.

## Exercise 123 [B]

I once went to the house of a celebrated man, who had formerly been a friend of mine, to ask if he would help me in a matter which I had in hand. The servant said he was not at home, but as I had caught sight of my friend, I knew the fellow lied. Some days after the great man came to my house, and I, having no servant, opened the door to him myself. On seeing him I exclaimed, with unmoved countenance, “He is not at home.” In astonishment my friend asked whether I was mad. To which I replied, “I believed your servant when he told lies about you. Are you not willing to believe me when I speak about myself?”

## Exercise 124 [A]

It was the custom of the Falisci to send their children to a schoolmaster to live with him. When the Romans were waging war with the Falisci, this schoolmaster thought that he would please the Romans if he gave them these children as hostages. He therefore purposely led them, without the knowledge of the citizens, to the Roman camp, and offered them to the general. The latter, however, asked him how he had dared to betray children who had been committed to his care, and threatened him with severe punishment. Then he told the children to take such rods as their master was himself accustomed to use, and with these to drive him to the city.

## Exercise 125 [A]

The news reached Rome that their army had been defeated, and that of the two consuls who were in command one had been killed and the other was a fugitive. At first the whole city was full of panic and grief. But soon the Senate assembled to take measures for the safety of the State. They decreed that those who were able to fight should go with the women and children to the capitol; but they declared that they themselves, who were old men and unable to bear arms, would remain in the city. The Gauls found these old men sitting in silence, and clothed in their state robes. At first they wondered greatly, but finally they approached the Senators, and a soldier stroked the long beard of one of them with his hand. The Senator, being enraged, struck the man, whereupon the rest of the Gauls slew all the Senators.

## Exercise 126 [B]

Solon, the wisest of the Athenians, went once to visit Croesus at Sardis. You have all heard how these two men became friends, and discussed many things together. But the story is worthy of being told again. Croesus considered that that man was most fortunate who had great power and riches, and who could do whatever he wished; and he thought that he himself was such a man. He therefore showed Solon all his gold and silver, and told him how many nations he ruled. He then asked him whom he considered the happiest of mortals. He was sure that Solon would answer that he who ruled the city of Sardis and such a great kingdom was the happiest. But Solon replied that two young men, Cleobis and Biton, were the most happy.

## Exercise 127 [B]

Croesus said he had never heard of these men, and asked Solon who they were. The latter replied that they were two youths of great piety, whose mother was a priestess; that when she wished to go to the temple the oxen which used to draw her cart had died, and that her two sons had drawn her there instead of the oxen; that therefore she had prayed to the gods to give them their best gift, and in the night they had both died. By this story Solon wishes to prove that those who are alive must not be accounted happy, since all are liable to misfortune; but that those who have met an honourable death are indeed the happiest.

## Exercise 128 — Impersonal Verbs  

1. In using oportet there is the same difficulty as in using debeo. In English we say, "I ought to have come," expressing the Perfect tense in the Infinitive. In Latin the tense must be expressed in the modal verb, not in the following Infinitive; e.g. Debui venire or oportuit me venire. Tlere is the same difference in the use of possum ; e.g. Potui hoc facere = I might have done this.
2. Remember that se refers to the subject of the sentence. An impersonal verb has no subject, and therefore cannot be followed directly by se; e.g. He was ashamed=eum puduit. If, however, the impersonal is used in an indirect statement se must be used for the third person, because it refers to the subject of the verb of saying; e.g. Dixit se pudere = He said he was ashamed. See Rule 7, p. 40.


- I repented of my crime.
- Do you pity the prisoner?
- They are weary of life.

## Exercise 133 [A]

Now when they had sailed for several days, it chanced that they caught sight of a ship of war approaching them. Some were afraid, and wished to turn back, but the captain said that he was ashamed to turn back, “For,” said he, “brave men ought to meet an enemy boldly, and I do not believe that by flight we shall escape from so large a vessel.” As the ship came near they saw that there were on board many soldiers, one of whom, by his proud looks and splendid dress, seemed to be the king. This man called out to them to come on board his ship. And when they had done this he asked them where they came from, and why they had left their homes.

## Exercise 134 [A]

On hearing their answer he asked them to sail with him, and promised to give them lands in his country, because they seemed to be good soldiers, and because he pitied them for their misfortunes. But they declared that they wished to discover what fortune the gods would give them in distant regions. Then the king replied that he was sorry for this resolve, but that he would no longer try to persuade them to follow him. He asked them if they needed gold or provisions; and when they said that they had no need of such things, he dismissed them kindly, and held on his course.

## Exercise 135 [A]

I have lately with much care found out and written in a book the strange stories which the inhabitants of this district believe. Among other things they believe that a man who throws a garment into the stream which flows near our town will be free from disease for a year. I have asked why they believe this, and they say that a god dwells in the stream; but why the god of a river wants such gifts they do not understand. They also believe that a certain spring which rises outside the town is able to make rich the man who visits it on a certain night in the summer; but on which of all the nights of summer one ought to visit the spring no man can tell, and I have never found a man made rich in this way.

## Exercise 136 [A]

The gallant Brutus, who had been blockaded for a long time, wished to know when the reinforcements would arrive. Accordingly he sent away two ships, under the command of his lieutenant, with the intention of informing the Roman commander in what great danger he was. But these ships being wrecked, the enemy surrounded them, and asked the lieutenant who they were and where they came from. On learning that they were Romans, they promised to spare their lives, and be their guides. But when they had led them two miles they surrounded and slew them. The Roman commander, on hearing of this through his scouts, decided not to delay any longer, but to send forward two legions as soon as possible.

## Exercise 137 [B]

When the king of France was besieging Amsterdam the citizens were greatly terrified, and summoned a council to consider what they ought to do. Most of them said that there was no hope of holding out any longer against the enemy, and advised that the keys of the city should be given up to the king. But they observed that one of the elders was asleep, and had not given his opinion. So they woke him up, and asked him what he advised about giving up the keys. He enquired if the king had demanded them; and when they said that he had not done so, he replied, “Then let us wait at least till he be pleased to ask for them.” It is said that these words saved the city.

## Exercise 138 [B]

The soldier, thus recognized, was soon surrounded by a mob of citizens asking who he was, where he came from, where he was going, for what purpose he was in the town, and why he had not come through the gates, but had climbed over the wall in the night time. In no wise terrified, he replied that neither could he answer so many things at once, nor was it the business of private citizens to know what was his name or what he came for. On which he was dragged with much violence to the magistrates, who questioned him again as to his purposes. As he would not speak, they were deliberating whether they ought to detain him or set him free; but there came up a soldier who pretended to recognize the prisoner, and asked whether he had not been seen in the rebels’ camp.

## Exercise 139 [B]

A boy and his sister were once found by the inhabitants of a village, near the entrance of a cavern. They were in form like other men, but they were different in the colour of their skin, which was tinged with a green colour. No one could understand what they said. When they were brought to the house of a certain knight they wept bitterly. Food being set before them they refused to touch it, though it was clear that they were tormented by great hunger. At length, when some beans were brought into the house, they asked by signs that these should be given them. They fed on these with great delight, and for a long time would eat no other food. The boy, however, was always languid and sad, and died in a short time.

## Exercise 140 [B]

The girl, however, becoming accustomed to various kinds of food at length lost that green colour. For many years she remained with the knight to whom she and her brother had first been brought. Being frequently asked about her country, she declared that the inhabitants were of a green colour, and that they saw no sun, but enjoyed such a light as we see after sunset. Being asked how she came into this country, she replied that as they were following their flocks they came to a certain cavern, where they heard a delightful sound of bells. Led on by this they wandered for a long time through the cavern, and at last reached its mouth. When they came out of it they said they were stupefied by the excessive heat of the sun, and were thus caught by the inhabitants of the village.

Hannibal first crossed the Pyrenees with an army of fifty thousand foot soldiers and nine thousand horse, without any difficulty. No Roman army appeared to hinder his march. He reached the Rhone safely, and found no Romans to oppose him. The Gauls, however, were prepared to bar his way, and Scipio, the Roman general, had arrived at Massilia; so Hannibal determined to cross the river without delay. He ordered such boats as were ready to be brought to him, and trees to be cut down from which to build others. In two days the boats were ready, but the Gauls were drawn up on the opposite bank to prevent the landing. Accordingly Hannibal sent a large number of his men some miles up the river, ordering them to cross and attack the Gauls in the rear upon a given signal.

## Exercise 148 [B]

The Carthaginians had now reached the highest point of the mountains; they encamped on a large plateau where they could rest for some days. But it was a cold and desolate place, and not one where they could remain long, especially as winter was approaching. Many had been left behind on the march, overcome with want and hardships; and the cold was terrible to men who came from Spain and Africa. But Hannibal encouraged them, and pointed out that from this place the road led downwards, and that it would soon lead them to a country where they would find friends. “There lies Italy,” cried he; “yonder is the way to Rome.”

## Exercise 153 [A]

While the Romans were waging war against the Samnites their general Postumius tried to lead an army into Samnium through a narrow pass. There is in the midst of this pass a broad and open plain, but in order to reach it an army must enter a narrow defile, and afterwards either it must go back by the same way or must get out by a still narrower defile into Samnium. The Romans reached the open plain, but attempting to proceed they could not escape, for meanwhile the Samnites had blocked both the defiles. To escape they had to climb the mountains, and having tried to do this many times in vain they had to fortify a camp where they were.

## Exercise 154 [B]

Accordingly Postumius sent ambassadors to ask for fair terms. Pontius the Samnite replied that they must give hostages and surrender their arms, and must themselves be sent under the yoke. At length these disgraceful conditions were accepted, and the Romans were allowed to depart. To reach home they had to pass through the country of their Campanian allies, and even ask them for food and clothes. The Roman Senate refused to accept the treaty, and sent back the consul to surrender himself to the Samnites.

News having been brought of Caesar’s approach, the Arverni, fearing that he would invade their territory, resolved to break down all the bridges over the river. Caesar was very anxious to cross as soon as possible, for he was afraid of being hindered all the summer by this river. He accomplished this by the following trick. He sent forward the greater part of his forces, and the enemy followed these, thinking that the whole army had set out. Thereupon Caesar, who had remained with a few men, ordered them to repair one of the bridges with all speed, fearing that they might not be able to finish the work before the return of the enemy.

## Exercise 159 [B]

A peasant on the point of death summoned his sons, and told them that the end of his life was near. “My sons,” he said, “I am not afraid that you will disobey my commands, or forget me when I am dead. I therefore bid you work diligently in my vineyard, for by doing this you will discover great riches.” When the old man died, his sons remembered his words, and began to dig up the soil with all their might, hoping to find great riches concealed there. Soon however they were afraid that they had been deceived, for they could find neither gold nor silver; and at first they regretted their labour. But at last they discovered what their father had intended, for by carefully digging up the ground, they made it so fertile that it produced excellent vines.

Amongst other things he was accused of making himself equal to the gods, because he had entered the city in a chariot drawn by four white horses, which were sacred to Jupiter and the Sun. He also made the soldiers still more angry, because he ordered them to return part of the spoils taken at Veii, that he might offer them to the god Apollo. Finally he was accused of having hidden some treasures which he ought to have given up to the people, and was obliged to go into exile.

## Exercise 163 [B]

Some Irishmen had been brought to trial on the charge of stirring up a revolution in their country. They asserted that they had done nothing contrary to the law of nations, since the English were oppressing their land, and they themselves were only trying to free her from an unjust dominion. Under these circumstances they declared that they by no means repented of their deed, especially because they had shown that it was not easy to govern Irishmen against their will. These words displeased many who were present; but since the prisoners were young, and had never before been accused of any crime, they were spared.

## Exercise 164 [A]

Now when the Delphians knew what great danger they were in, great fear fell upon them. In their terror they consulted the oracle concerning the holy treasures, and enquired if they should bury them in the ground, or carry them away to another country. The god replied that they must leave the treasures untouched. “He was able,” he said, “without help to protect his own.” So the Delphians, when they received this answer, began to deliberate how to save themselves. First of all they sent their women and children across the gulf into Achaia. After which the greater number of them climbed to the top of Parnassus, and placed their goods in a cave. In this way all the Delphians quitted the city, except sixty men and the prophet.

They did not know to what lands they would come, but they had resolved to sail towards the west.

## Exercise 166 [B]

The two armies had been gazing at each other a long time. At last an old man came forward, and asked that a warrior from each army should be chosen to fight for his countrymen. Accordingly Sohrab came forward from the one army and Rustum, his father, from the other; but neither of them knew who the other was. For it happened that when Sohrab was born and carried off by the Scythians, his father was absent. At first Sohrab prevailed; for Rustum hurled his spear with such violence that he slipped and fell on the ground. But quickly rising, he dealt his son a deadly wound; for Sohrab had heard Rustum, as he rushed forward, shout out his name, and knowing him to be his father, he did not even move a hand to defend himself.

## Exercise 167 [B]

King James’s army was far superior to Monmouth’s in numbers, but with such great carelessness did they take up their position on that night that they were almost surprised and destroyed by the rebels. By chance the guides whom Monmouth trusted had not told him that there was a ditch twenty-five feet wide which defended the king’s camp in front. Therefore when the rebels were just going to rush forward to attack the ramparts, they were stopped by this trench. The officers ordered their men to throw the waggons into it, but the guards of the other army were now aroused, and their artillery began to play upon the rebels. It is said that Monmouth, having exhorted his men to fight bravely and hold their ground, himself rode out of the fight, hoping to find some place where he might be safe.
