# THE ORDER OF WORDS

## IN THE SIMPLE SENTENCE

### 1. Normal Order

A word receives most emphasis when placed at the beginning or end of a sentence; therefore in an ordinary Latin sentence place the Subject first and the Predicate last.

N.B. By the Predicate we do not mean necessarily the Verb. When the verb esse is used with adjectives or participles it need not take the last place.

### 2. Arrangement of the Middle of the Sentence

Expressions which naturally qualify the subject (generally adjectives or adjectival expressions) must be grouped near the subject; expressions which qualify the predicate (objects, adverbial and prepositional expressions) must be grouped before the verb.

### 3. Connecting Words

Before the subject will naturally come any words which connect with the preceding sentence; e.g. relatives, expressions of time, etc. Latin sentences do not usually follow one another without some expressed connection. In English we constantly leave the connection to be understood from the general sense.

Thus a Latin simple sentence, in which there is no need to emphasise particular words, will usually be arranged in this order:

1. Connecting words  
2. Subject  
3. Attributes of Subject  
4. Objects and attributes of the Objects  
5. Adverbial expressions qualifying Predicate  
6. Predicate

- Postero die mane | Servilius consul cum omnibus copiis | flumen quam celerrime transit.

  _Early next day the consul Servilius with all his forces crosses the river as speedily as possible._

- Quibus rebus auditis | dux hostium, vir magna belli peritia | suos ex castello se recipere iubet.

  _When he heard this news the leader of the enemy, who had gained experience in many wars, ordered his men to leave the fort._

### 4. Special Emphasis

To emphasise any special word it must be placed out of its usual position. The Predicate is most emphasised by being placed first, the Subject by being placed last or nearly last. Any other word will be emphasised by taking either of these positions. An attribute separated from its noun, or an adverb separated from its verb, is thereby emphasised.

- Habet senectus magnam auctoritatem. _Old age certainly has great influence._
- Hac clade periit libertas. _It was liberty that perished in this disaster._
- Recte igitur deos esse diximus. _We were right in saying that there are gods._
- Exempla proponamus illi optima. _Let the examples we set before him be the best._

In English also we can sometimes emphasise by order; e.g. “A friend I am unwilling to accuse.” But we more often put the emphatic words in a clause by themselves. Compare “It is not often that a rich man envies the poor” with the Latin Haud saepe invidet pauperibus dives, where the necessary emphasis on “not often” is given by position.

### 5. Attributes, etc.

An adjective more often follows than precedes its noun, and a slight emphasis is often given by placing it first.

- Vir bonus ac sapiens. _A good and wise man._
- Bonum ac sapientem virum fingimus. _It is the good and wise man that we are describing._

Nouns in apposition generally follow the noun to which they are attached. If they precede it they are thereby emphasised.

- Lemnos insula = _the island of Lemnos._
- Insula Lemnos = _the island Lemnos (as opposed to the town)._
- Servilius consul = _the consul Servilius._
- Consul Servilius = _Servilius when consul, or as consul._

Where there is both an attribute and some defining phrase (a case or a prepositional phrase), put the latter between the attribute and the noun.

- Multa tua erga me beneficia. _Your many kindnesses to me._
- Filius patri similis. _A son like his father._

## THE COMPOUND SENTENCE

### 6. The Compound Sentence 

The Compound Sentence consists of a Principal Clause and Subordinate Clauses. The subordinate clauses all stand in some relation to the principal verb or its subject, being equivalent to nouns, adjectives, or adverbs; and they will for the most part fall into the places that these would have occupied if the sentence had been simple.

| Simple | Compound |
|--------|----------|
| Quibus rebus auditis, Iberorum dux, vir magna belli peritia, collectis omnibus copiis, impediendi causa Romanos, pontem rescindit. | Quae cum audiisset, Iberorum dux, qui bellorum peritissimus erat, cum omnes copias collegisset, ne Romani celerius advenirent, pontem rescindi iubet. |
| Hearing this, the Iberian leader, a man of great experience in warfare, collected all his forces, and broke down the bridge in order to delay the Romans. | When the Iberian leader, who had had great experience in warfare, heard this, he collected all his forces, and ordered the bridge to be broken down, so as to delay the Romans’ advance. |

The main principle therefore of the Compound Sentence is that the subordinate parts of the sentences are enclosed between the subject, which must stand near the beginning, and the principal verb, which will most frequeently come at the end. The order of the clauses will therefore naturally be as follows:

1. Any clause which connects with the previous sentence  
2. The subject followed by any attributive clauses belonging to it  
3. Clauses belonging to the predicate:  
   - (a) adverbial clauses of time, etc.  
   - (b) object clauses (Acc. + Inf., Indirect Questions, Commands)  
4. The Predicate

- Quod cum vidisset dux, quia quid hostis paret nescit, paullum moratur.

  _Seeing this, the general delayed a little time, because he did not known what the enemy was preparing to do._
  
- Reliquis diebus Caesar, ne qui inermibus militibus impetus fieri posset, omnem eam materiam, quae erat caesa, conversam ad hostem conlocabat.

  _During the remaining days Caesar piled up facing the enemy all the timber that had been cut, sot that no attack might be made on his men when unarmed._

- Tamen Senones, quae est civitas imprimis firma et magnae inter Gallos auctoritatis, Cavarinum, quem Caesar apud eos regem constituerat, interficere publico consilio conati, cum ille praesensisset ac profugisset, usque ad fines insecuti regno domoque expulerunt.

  _Nevertheless the Senones, who are the strongest and most influential tribe among the Gauls, tried to kill Cavarinus, whom Caesar had  made king among them, and when he found out the plot and fled, pursued him as far as their boundaries, and drove him from his kingdom and home._

But these principles will be modified by many considerations of (a) Emphasis, (b) Logical Arrangement, (c) Sound. No system of rules can take the place of observation in reading, but the following suggestions may be added.

### (a) Emphasis
As in the Simple Sentence, the beginning and end are emphatic positions, and a subordinate clause may be emphasised by being placed in one of these positions. It often happens that the verb which is grammatically the principal verb is not the important part of the predicate, and in that case it will not come last. This is especially frequent with the verb of "saying" that introduces Oratio Obliqua, which is not as a rule kept to the end of the sentence.

e.g. Eo cum de improviso celeriusque omni opinione venisset, Remi, qui proximi Galliae ex Belgis sunt, ad eum legatos miserunt qui dicerent se suaque omnia in fidem atque in potestatem populi Romani permittere.

_But Caesar arriving there suddenly and sooner than anyone had expected, the Remi, who are the nearest to Gaul of the Belgian tribes, sent him ambassadors to say that they surrendered themselves and all they possessed to the sway and authority of the Roman people._

In this sentence miserunt is the principal verb, and dicerent the main verb of the subordinate clause, but neither contains the main statement of the sentcnce, and therefore neither stands last. The object of the sentence is to give the message of the Remi "se ... permittere." It is a common mistake of beginners to think they must write "legatos qui se... permittere dicerent miserunt."

For the same reason a Purpose Clause or Causal Clause will stand last, if to state the Purpose or Cause is the real object of the sentence; i.e. if it is more emphatic than the statement of the Principal Verb. Compare the following:
- _He said it to frighten me._ Haec dixit ut me terreret.
- _He threatened me with torture to frighten me._ Ut me terreret cruciatum mihi minabatur.

In the first sentence to state the purpose is the object of the sentence. In the second the principal verb contains the main idea.

### (b) Logical Arrangement

It is generally essential to clearness that the statement of circumstances (e.g. time, place etc.) should precede the main statement, and statement of cause precede the statement of the effect. For this reason a Consecutive sentence will almost always come after the verb it depends on, though grammatically subordinate.

It also tends to clearness to observe the following:

1. When the principal verb and subordinate verb have the same subject, do not put the subject, as we do in English, inside the subordinate clause ; e.g. for "_When Caesar heard this, he returned,_" say, "Caesar, quum haec audiisset, rediit."
2. In translating complicated English sentences into Latin avoid the frequent change of subjeet which we allow in English. The change of Active for Passive will often obviate difficulty.

### (c) Sound.

If we followed universally the rule of enclosing subordinate clauses, we should find three or four verbs sometimes together at the end of the sentence. Avoid this by altering the arrangement of words in one or more of the clauses.

Avoid generally placing together similar terminations (especially -orum, -arum). Avoid also a sentence consisting entirely of words of the same length; e.g. such a combination as "Erat quondam pastor quidam Gygis regis."

The sound often helps the sense; e.g. where the writer wishes to describe a series of events rapidly following one another he may use a series of short sentences, even without conjunctions.

e.g. Concilium dimittit, Liscum retinet. Quaerit ex solo ea quae in conventu dixerat. Dicit liberius atque audacius, Eadem secreto ab aliis quaerit; reperit esse vera.

_On dismissing the council he detained Liscus and enquired of him privately about those matters that he had mentioned at the meeting. Liscus spolce then more openly and boldly, and by private enquiries from others Caesar found that his statements were true._

### 7. Pronouns

(a) The Relative always comes first in its clause where possible.

e.g.

- _These towns, one of which has been burnt._ Haec oppida, quorum unum incensum est (never unum quorum).
- _Catiline is here, by whose slaves he was killed._ Adest Catilina cujus ab servis interfectus est (not ab cujus servis).

So quamobrem, qua de causa, quas inter urbes, &c.

But if the relative is used substantivally, the preposition will precede it as a rule-inter quos, ex quibus, &c.

(b) Many adjectives (especially superlatives) and words in apposition are attracted into the Relative clause in Latin contrary to English usage.

e.g. _The beautiful city of Corinth, which was destroyed by L. Mummius._ Corinthus quae urbs pulcherrima ab L. Mummio diruta est.

(c) Observe that cases of se, suus, ipse, quisque in the same sentence generally stand next one another.

e.g.

- Suae quisque fortunae faber. _Each man is the maker of his own fortune._
- Sceleris sui sibi conscius. _Conscious of his guilt._
