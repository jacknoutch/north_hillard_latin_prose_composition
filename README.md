# README: North & Hillard Latin Prose Composition

The repository is a digitisation of North & Hillard's classic Latin Prose Composition.

The digitisation is derived from the edition on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/north-m.-hilladr-a.-latin-prose-composition-1913/page/n1/mode/1up).

Sections have been digitised with a mixture of AI tools, including OCR and chat, under human instruction. Materials have been cursorily checked by a human eye, and a more systemised verification will be undertaken.

## Edits

The documents are intended to be a faithful digitisation of the textbook, but it is not an absolute reproduction.

In particular, not preserved is layout on the page; formatting for marking the sections of text; the italicisation or other differentiation made between Latin and English, glosses, and ordinary text.

Obvious errors have been corrected.
